# 📅 Day 01 – Arrays

## 📌 Topic Overview

Day 1 focused on **Arrays**, the most fundamental data structure in DSA. The goal was not speed, but understanding **how to traverse data, track values efficiently, and reason about time and space complexity** using simple logic.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* What is an array and how it stores data
* Traversing an array using loops
* Finding minimum and maximum elements
* Calculating sum and average
* Counting elements based on conditions (even numbers)
* Understanding **Time Complexity (O(n))**
* Understanding **Space Complexity (O(1))**

---

## 🧪 Practice Problems

The following types of problems were practiced:

* Find the minimum element in an array
* Find the maximum element in an array
* Count even numbers in an array
* Find the second largest element
* Analyze time and space complexity for each solution

All problems were solved using **basic loops without built-in functions** to strengthen core logic.

## 🧩 Mini Project

### Daily Expense Analyzer

A small real-life project built using arrays to:

* Track daily expenses
* Find highest and lowest spending
* Calculate total and average expenses
* Draw basic insights from numerical data

This project helped connect array traversal logic to a **real-world use case**.

## 📝 Key Learnings

* One loop can solve multiple problems efficiently
* Initializing variables correctly is crucial for correct logic
* Logic clarity is more important than language shortcuts
* Time complexity matters more than number of variables

---

## 🚀 Takeaway

Day 1 built the foundation for future DSA topics. Instead of memorizing solutions, the focus was on **thinking step by step and building confidence with basic logic**.
